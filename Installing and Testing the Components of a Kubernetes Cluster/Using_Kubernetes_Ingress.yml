Using_Kubernetes_Ingress
Introduction
Kubernetes Ingress allows you to customize how external entities can interact with your Kubernetes applications via the network. This lab will allow you to exercise your knowledge of Kubernetes Ingress. You will use Ingress to open access from an existing service to an external server.

Solution
Log in to the server using the credentials provided:

ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
Create a Service to Expose the web-auth Deployment
Check out the deployment:

kubectl get deployment web-auth -o yaml
Note the web-auth label on our Pods. We'll use this label to select these Pods using our Service.

Create a web-auth-svc.yml file:

vi web-auth-svc.yml
Paste the following YAML definitions:

Note: To paste YAML directly into the Vi/Vim editor, first enter the command :set paste.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: web-auth-svc
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: web-auth
  ports:
    - name: http
      protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
Press Esc and enter :wq to save and exit.

Create the Service:

kubectl create -f web-auth-svc.yml
Create an Ingress That Maps to the New Service
Create a web-auth-ingress.yml file:

vi web-auth-ingress.yml
Add the following YAML definitions:

Note: To paste YAML directly into the Vi/Vim editor, first enter the command :set paste.

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: web-auth-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /auth
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: web-auth-svc
            port:
              number: 80
Press Esc and enter :wq to save and exit.

Create the Ingress:

kubectl create -f web-auth-ingress.yml
Check the status of the Ingress:

kubectl describe ingress web-auth-ingress
Note the service endpoints in the Backends section of the output. You have successfully created an Ingress that maps to the backend Service.

Conclusion
Congratulations â€” you've completed this hands-on lab!
